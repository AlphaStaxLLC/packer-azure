The files **packer-builder-azure** and **packer-provisioner-azure-custom-script-extension** are Packer plug-ins. 

How to install plug-ins you can find here: http://www.packer.io/docs/extend/plugins.html

As the plug-ins names follow Packer plug-in name convention - the simplest way to install the plug-ins just download them to your Packer folder and chmod them.
